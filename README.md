# CustomMFD
Custom dual monitor MFD export for DCS WORLD 

Hi, use this file to export the MFDs(or some other display in older aircraft, such as VDI in the f14, the radar display on F5 and Mig21, or the ABRIS in the KA50) video signal to an external monitor. By default is configurated as a 1440p monitor for the main screen(where the game is running), and an additional 768p monitor for the MFD export, wich is placed on the right side under the main screen. Make sure that those settings correspont to your configuration by cheking it on windows.

If you have a different aspect ratio monitor you have to manually adjust the value in the file to mathc your settings.

NOTE: the JF17 monitor exports might be a little streched bucause it's the only way to match the different aspect ratio of the MFD installed on the aircraft. Now it show only the superior parts of the monitor over the white line so you can push the button on The Cougar MFD whitout the ugly misalignment that occurred in the default export.
